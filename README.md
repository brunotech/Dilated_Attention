# Dilated_Attention


## Description

This project contains code to train a language model with Dilated Attention using a dataset with 1 billion input tokens.

## Functionality

The code is written in Python and can be executed in a Jupyter notebook in the Google Colab environment. It is divided into several main parts:

1. **Model Definition**: The code starts by defining the structure of the language model with Dilated Attention, including the Dilated Attention layer, the LSTM model, and the output layer. The model is implemented using the PyTorch library.

2. **Dataset Loading**: Next, there is a `load_dataset()` function responsible for loading and processing the dataset. In this example, we use the "cerebras/SlimPajama-627B" dataset available in the Hugging Face library. However, you can replace this function to load your own dataset.

3. **Model Training**: After loading the dataset, the code proceeds with training the model. It sets hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size. It then iterates over the training data, performs the forward pass, calculates the loss, performs the backward pass, and optimizes the model's parameters.

4. **Fine-tuning with Instructions**: The README also mentions the possibility of fine-tuning the pre-trained model with Dilated Attention using a new dataset with instructions. In this case, the steps to load the pre-trained model, freeze its parameters, create a new model with instructions, and perform fine-tuning are provided.

## Requirements

To run the code, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: PyTorch, torchtext, datasets

## How to Run

1. Download the project code.
2. Open a Jupyter notebook in the Google Colab environment.
3. Upload the project code to the Colab environment.
4. Customize the code according to your needs, such as the dataset path, model and training hyperparameters.
5. Run the code in the Colab notebook and monitor the model training.
